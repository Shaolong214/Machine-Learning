## Data Sets

- A training set of 13,902 job descriptions. The first 8,000 descriptions are labeled with the job’s salary (target label) and gender balance of the job’s occupation group (demographic label). The remaining 5,902 descriptions are unlabelled. You may use these for semi- or unsupervised learning approaches.
- A development set of 1,738 labeled job descriptions, with target and demographic labels which you should use for model selection and tuning;
- A test set of 1,737 job descriptions, with no target (but demographic) labels, which will be used for final evaluation in the Kaggle in-class competition
